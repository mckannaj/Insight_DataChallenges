# Insight_DataChallenges
**Overview**<br>
Each week at Insight Health Data Science, we're offered a data challenge akin to what one might find during an interview process. Each involves one or more datasets and business problems which can be investigated through data science. We're instructed to spend no more than 4 hours on each (similar to what might be expected for a data challenge during the interview process).<br>
Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a single challenge. Within each folder can be found:<br>
1. The original challenge, usually in .pdf
2. The dataset(s), usually in .csv
3. My solution, a combination of code and descriptive Markdown in a Jupyter notebook<br>
